abstract: ' Computational aesthetics evaluation has made great achievements in visual works of art, but its research in the field of music remains to be explored. At present, subjective evaluation is still a ultimate method of music aesthetics research, but it will consume a lot of human and material resources. In addition, there has been a lot of work on artificial intelligence to generate music performance, but compared with the performance of human performers, the performance generated by AI is still mechanical, monotonous and lacking in beauty. Considering the lack of subjective rating datasets, in order to guide the generation task of AI music performance, and further hope to improve the performance effect of human performers, this paper uses Birkhoff’s aesthetic measure to propose a method of objective measurement of beauty. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: Firstly, we put forward an objective aesthetic evaluation method to measure the music performance aesthetic; Secondly, we propose 10 basic music features and 4 aesthetic music features; Finally, we use the ASAP dataset and VirtuosoNet to generate performance for experiments on our model. Experiments show that our method performs well on performance assessment.'
