abstract: 'One key challenge of pose transfer lies in its large variation and occlusion. Existing methods are basically aimed at the migration of the pose in a single input image. So these methods have difficulties predicting reasonable invisible re-gions and fail to decouple the shape and style of clothing. Although pose transfer method using single input image can generate the results with correct structure, it cannot keep the original details of the image. To solve this problem, we propose a two-stage generative model for pose transfer based on multiple input images. First, the Feature Extraction Stage, then Reposing Stage. In feature extraction stage, we extract relevant features from each input image. Then, in reposing stage, we propose a pose-conditioned transformer-based StyleGAN generator, adding residual module and fusion module at different levels of the generator. In this way, we can get the most relevant features from each input image for weighted fusion, thus improving the quality of the results. We show that our method compares favorably against those using single input image in both quantitative evaluation and visual comparison.'
