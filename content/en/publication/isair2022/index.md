abstract: 'In recent years, due to the improvement of scientific research methods and the wide-open source and acquisition of related data sets, face stylization has become a hot research field and application direction. There is a need to stylize face images in many applications, such as camera beauty, artistic photo processing, etc. However, most of the current schemes are not satisfactory, and the resultant image synthesis traces are obvious, and the effect is relatively monotonous. Based on the study of image features and style representation, this paper proposes a general-purpose face image style transfer whole process scheme. It can fill the gap in local style transfer of face images. Among the existing face stylization methods, the face stylization method is more complex, and the resulting obvious image synthesis trace along with the single effect. The project innovates the existing technology that can split the whole picture and implements the following six functions. Including the segmentation of specific portrait parts (hair), the skin buffing and whitening of the face, the defuzzification of the photos, the style transfer of the hair, the messy hair removal, and the implementation of the big eye effect. This study can realize the automatic style conversion of specific face images quickly and with high quality.'
